# Bienvenidos a Gardenny!!! <3

Personal project of a game in a website where you can create your own plants and pets, take care of them or let them die!

🔹 I made my own database to create User, Pets and Plants linked to the logged user. </br>
🔹 Some routes are protected with a token. User must login or register to view them. </br>
🔹 I designed it with Figma, used Vue as framework for the frontend and Vuex to apply the flux pattern. </br>
🔹 Everything is tested using Jest Vue-test-utils and testing Library.</br>
🔹 I decided to use Typescript for frontend and Javascript for backend.</br>

## Technologies Used

⭐ Frontend: Vue | Vuex | Jest | SASS | BEM | Typescript

⭐ Backend: NodeJS | ExpressJS | MongoDB | Mongoose | PostMan | Passport | JWT | API Restful

⭐ Other: Figma
